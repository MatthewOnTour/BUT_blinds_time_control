# Home Assistant Blinds Control Integration

Upgrade your Home Assistant with this custom blinds control integration. It's designed to effortlessly manage your time-based blinds, syncing with your chosen entities for raising and lowering. Plus, it remembers your settings after restarts and supports tilting.

## How to Install

Getting started is a piece of cake!
You can add this integration through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) or simply copy all files from the custom_components/blinds_controller directory into your Home Assistant's /custom_components/blinds_controller/ directory. Then, just give Home Assistant a quick restart, and you're good to go.

## Setting Things Up

Head over to Settings -> Devices and Services -> Click on Add Integration (select Blinds Control) to integrate your blinds into the system.

Name your blinds, select the controlling entities, specify roll-up and roll-down times in seconds, and if you need it, set tilt times (or leave them at 0 if you don't want tilting support).

You can also tweak existing configurations to suit your preferences.
